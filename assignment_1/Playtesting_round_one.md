**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules were very understandable! As someone who played call of duty already, everything was uderstood faster.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ As of today, this game is pretty much ruined by hackers and such. Almost all the lobbies are modded lobbies so they're not as enjoyable as back in the day. If they did continue to work on this game, it would definitely be to add an anti-cheat system. 

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ This game used to be balanced but here and there you'll be able to find a decent game where everyone plays fair. But you will find lobbies where that one person goes what they call "tryhard" meaning they want to be the best of the best at what they do at every game. 

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing of each game seems about right. A simple team deathmatch or search & destroy is really good on the time. Doesn't take too long and it isn't too fast.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ I personally think, everything clashed together very nicely. It had this simple theme and everything was easily understood. The mechanics of the game were also easy to understand once you figured out what the perks did to help your loadout.
