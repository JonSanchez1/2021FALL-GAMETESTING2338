### Rating

I give this game a 10 star rating out of 10 stars.

## Summary

This game is about a character named Sora going on an adventure to destroy the  heartless. He goes around disney worlds making new friends and destroying any heartless that come their way. Ultimately he is trying to stop the keyblade war from happening when the seven guardians of light and the thirteen darkness collide. We may lose but its the power of friends that overcome any obstacle that comes their  way.



This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarizing the
game play mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what,
when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts

Describe in as much detail as possible what you did and didn't enjoy about the
game and list out your reasons why. Remember this is a review and thus should
stand up to some criticism when making your reasons why you thought this way
about particular features of the game. This should be at a minimum of 1
paragraph.
