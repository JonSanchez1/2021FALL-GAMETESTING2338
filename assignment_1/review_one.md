### Rating

I give this game a 10 star rating out of 10 stars.

## Summary

This game is about a character named Sora going on an adventure to destroy the  heartless. He goes around disney worlds making new friends and destroying any heartless that come their way. Ultimately he is trying to stop the keyblade war from happening when the seven guardians of light and the thirteen darkness collide. We may lose but its the power of friends that overcome any obstacle that comes their  way.

Sora, one of the keyblade warriors, traveling to different worlds saving them from the heartless. He tries his best to remember the power of waking because he was told this power will be useful for when the time is right. He helps out the others on getting the seven guardians of light back together. They all have to train vigorously to attain maximum strength for the upcoming keyblade war between the light and darknesses. 

The seven guardians of light must work together to defeat the 13 darknesses and prevent a keyblade war from happening. The darknesses end up almost taking over kingdom hearts until sora finds his way back to the world and saving everyone else and finally being able to defeat xehanort. It takes place in a keyblade graveyard and then it shifts over to a few other locations. They fight there way against the darkness until the darkness becomes too strong and takes the seven guardians of light away one by one. 

Organization XIII wants to destroy and take over Kingdom Hearts so the good side, being the seven guardians of light, must work together to stop them in their tracks. Throughout the whole franchise, its been leading up to this game where they were finally able to gather the 13 darknesses to take over kingdom hearts. As for the good side, they were able to finally achieve the seven gurdians of light as well, even though it was unbalanced, light always win! It's taken years for this keyblade war to happen but it must be stopped at all cost. As they once said, "on that land shall darkness prevail and light expire, the keyblade war will commence" but what they don't know is there is more than meets the eye.

## Final Thoughts

I personally am a big fan when it comes to the kingdom hearts franchise they've created. When I first started up this game, I was super excited to hear how the story would play it because, the story can be a bit complicated as to the time of when things are actually occuring. I will say, the timeline of kingdom hearts is a bit odd but it does make more sense when you play them in chronological order. Even though that's not how I played them, I was still able to understand when the game took place. And to be playing this game and finally grabbing some sense as to how everything is connecting for this one "final" story, it is amazing! Everything they added, everything they made for this game is immense! It took me a few days to complete the game but I took my time with it becaus I for one like to enjoy the beauty of the game and the amount of different side quests/objectives you can do. I personally don't have any negative comments to say about this game. I really enjoyed this game a ton!
