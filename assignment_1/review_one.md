## Summary

This game is about a character named Sora going on an adventure to destroy the  heartless. He goes around disney worlds making new friends and destroying any heartless that come their way. Ultimately he is trying to stop the keyblade war from happening when the seven guardians of light and the thirteen darkness collide. We may lose but its the power of friends that overcome any obstacle that comes their  way.

Sora, one of the keyblade warriors, traveling to different worlds saving them from the heartless. He tries his best to remember the power of waking because he was told this power will be useful for when the time is right. He helps out the others on getting the seven guardians of light back together. They all have to train vigorously to attain maximum strength for the upcoming keyblade war between the light and darknesses. 

The seven guardians of light must work together to defeat the 13 darknesses and prevent a keyblade war from happening. The darknesses end up almost taking over kingdom hearts until sora finds his way back to the world and saving everyone else and finally being able to defeat xehanort. It takes place in a keyblade graveyard and then it shifts over to a few other locations. They fight there way against the darkness until the darkness becomes too strong and takes the seven guardians of light away one by one. 

Organization XIII wants to destroy and take over Kingdom Hearts so the good side, being the seven guardians of light, must work together to stop them in their tracks. Throughout the whole franchise, its been leading up to this game where they were finally able to gather the 13 darknesses to take over kingdom hearts. As for the good side, they were able to finally achieve the seven gurdians of light as well, even though it was unbalanced, light always win! It's taken years  


on that land shall darkness prevail and light expire, the keyblade war will commence
