## Summary

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clash Royale is a real-time turn based game. You collect different cards to obtain troops to create your own battle deck and fight on other players real-time. You are then able to level up your troops using cards, and depending on how many cards you've collected of that troop, you can upgrade it using coins. Now coins is probably one of the biggest factor in the game, so the more you play, the more coins you are able to achieve. With every win you achieve, you'll be rewarded with a random chest, and it can be from crate to a legendary chest. Each chest contains different items that can help you improve your battle deck or even upgrade your cards. 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game consists of different card rarity's, you have common, rare, epic and legendary. Common cards are easier to get than legendary cards. In order to get cards, you have to unlock them through either chests or you can buy them from the daily deals shop. The daily deals shop refreshes every 24 hours, so it will always be different. It will also reflect on what arena you're in currently, occasionally you'll see a free item in the shop so I highly recommend always checking the daily deals shop. It can be some free epic cards, a pouch of gold or maybe even a few gems. Gems are generally used for buying emotes inside the emote shop, buying chests inside the royale chests shop or even using your gems for gold. 
  
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So clash royale also consist of arenas. Every time you win, you win a certain amount of trophies that will eventually place you in an arena, the more trophies you have, the higher arena you'll be in. Currently the highest arena there is, is called Legendary Arena. To be in that arena, you'll have to have 5000+ trophies. Don't worry if you lose trophies when you're placed in an arena, you'll be in the arena still unless you drop more than 100 trophies, you will then be demoted to the arena under you. With every arena, you can unlock certain cards pertaining to that arena level. Also when you win, you'll get a chest to be unlocked. Every chest is different and depending on the chest you get, it can take from 3 hours to 24 hours. Lucky for you, you can choose to wait out the time or you can use gems to unlock them. The longer it takes to unlock, the more gems you'll need to unlock it. So be sure to keep on playing until all your chest slots are taken up, you only have 4 chest slots, so it'll be easy for you to fill them!

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now something cool Clash Royale has added, is the tournament events. Inside these tournaments, you'll have a chance to unlock a new card before it gets officially released or get more coins, gems, chests and even magic items. Magic items can be used to upgrade any card even if you dont have the required amount of that card to upgrade. So let's say you have 87/100 until you can upgrade your troop, you can use these magic items in place of the other 13 cards you need to upgrade it. They also have other magic items such as upgrade a card instantly without the use of anything else, or upgrading a card without you needing to spend gold on it. Or you can even get lucky to get a chest key to use it on one of the 4 chest you have among your chest slots. This game has so many cool little things and so much to make the game more fun. Hopefully I'll see you trying out this game sometime soon, give it a try and you wont regret it!
