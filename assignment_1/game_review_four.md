## Summary

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like the competitive shooter type of games, you're in for a treat. Valorant is best known for its competitive side when it comes to the game. They're always updating the game with new seasons which they're actually called "Acts". It adds new agents, maps and even game modes. So it's a fast paced game, so you have to be quick on your feet because you never know whats around the corner. It's a 5v5 and the first team that successfully wins 13 rounds, wins the game!
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game consists of  16 agents at the moment, but they do plan to keep adding more agents over time. Now you only have a few to actually pick when you first start playing the game, because the other agents are locked. You'll have to unlock the other agents as you level up and gain experience. Each character has four unique abilites including their ultimate. With every round that you play, you can use one free ability. And with every round you continue playing, you can choose to either spend your money on guns, ammo and such or you can save it for a future round. Just know that when it is time to switch sides, your money will reset. So after the first 12 rounds, you'll be switching sides to change things up.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another cool feature they added, was the in game purchases. So as of right now you're able to buy gun skins and valorant points to unlock various agents. You can choose to either buy your way into different agents or you can gain experience and unlock them over time. To unlock an agent, is roughly about 1,000 valorant points or you can buy them which would be about $9.99. Me personally, I would recommend just play the game until you have enough experience to unlock them one by one. But the option is there in case you would like to buy them from the get-go.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if you plan to play competitively, you better start practicing. Within each Act (Season) there is a total of 8 ranks. You have Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Immortal & Radiant. Radiant would be your highest rank achievable at the moment. When it comes to actually playing each game out, you have to make sure you're playing with precision. Make sure what agents your team is running. Certain agents have unique abilities that could help you achieve the win easier. Are you able to play with other agents if someone else takes your agent? Are you playing with your team? Are you playing with other people? Is everyone playing efficiently? There is a lot of steps you need to consider before you get placed in a rank you don't necessarily want.

## Final Thoughts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally think the game was created very good! I absolutely love the puzzles within the dungeons to add this unique element. If it is just a dungeon, you walk in and go straight to the boss fight, that seems pretty boring. But when they add these puzzle elements and you have to find certain items to move on with the dungeon and unlock more paths, that makes it more exciting! They also add hidden items within certain objects/walls when you use those certain items. I think it is really cool when in order to achieve something, you must have this one item from another dungeon or after you buy it from the item shop in the game. Little things like that, really add this unique aspect to the game to make it more worth playing.
