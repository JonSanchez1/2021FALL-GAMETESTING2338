## Summary

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like the competitive shooter type of games, you're in for a treat. Valorant is best known for its competitive side when it comes to the game. They're always updating the game with new seasons which they're actually called "Acts". It adds new agents, maps and even game modes. So it's a fast paced game, so you have to be quick on your feet because you never know whats around the corner. It's a 5v5 and the first team that successfully wins 13 rounds, wins the game!
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game consists of  16 agents at the moment, but they do plan to keep adding more agents over time. Now you only have a few to actually pick when you first start playing the game, because the other agents are locked. You'll have to unlock the other agents as you level up and gain experience. Each character has four unique abilites including their ultimate. With every round that you play, you can use one free ability. And with every round you continue playing, you can choose to either spend your money on guns, ammo and such or you can save it for a future round. Just know that when it is time to switch sides, your money will reset. So after the first 12 rounds, you'll be switching sides to change things up.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another cool feature they added, was the in game purchases

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like the adventure type games or you like solving unique puzzles, you will definitely love playing this game. Even though its one of the older type of games, it still stands the test of time. Being a simpler puzzle and fairly easy to solve once you know what you're doing. Also the The legend of Zelda gmae series have always brought originality and something unique to the table when it comes to creating the game with this unique aspect. You're a young hero and you go on your quests of journeys to explore different types of dungeons and defeating the boss within the dungeons themselves to receive rewards upon defeat. 

## Final Thoughts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally think the game was created very good! I absolutely love the puzzles within the dungeons to add this unique element. If it is just a dungeon, you walk in and go straight to the boss fight, that seems pretty boring. But when they add these puzzle elements and you have to find certain items to move on with the dungeon and unlock more paths, that makes it more exciting! They also add hidden items within certain objects/walls when you use those certain items. I think it is really cool when in order to achieve something, you must have this one item from another dungeon or after you buy it from the item shop in the game. Little things like that, really add this unique aspect to the game to make it more worth playing.
