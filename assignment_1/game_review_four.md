## Summary

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like the competitive shooter type of games, you're in for a treat. Valorant is best known for its competitive side when it comes to the game. 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While exploring these various dungeons, he must also find new weapons on this journey do defeat these enemies surrounding the dungeons. He must also collect rupees to buy certain items to be used along his journey across all dungeons. He has to solve puzzles, fight enemies and defeat all bosses that are holding one of the 8 instruments to help him awaken the whale and escape the island. There is also mini-bosses around the island he must get through to collect more items and keep exploring the island. There will be shadow nightmanres lurking through each dungeon so you have to prepared to defeat them, otherwise they'll defeat you.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also other quests you can accomplish in this game such as photography and the famous hidden color dungeon. You can get to this dungeon pretty early on in the game after completing the second dungeon if you really wanted to. But it can only be accessible on a Game Boy Color. For the photographer quest, you have to talk to the photographer and he will ask you a questions to see if you want your picture taken. They implemented a neat little feature to where you are only able get one picture with the photographer, so if he agrees then he'll do a certain pose but if he answers all the questions with no, he will do a different pose. But you'll never be able to achieve both poses in a single file.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like the adventure type games or you like solving unique puzzles, you will definitely love playing this game. Even though its one of the older type of games, it still stands the test of time. Being a simpler puzzle and fairly easy to solve once you know what you're doing. Also the The legend of Zelda gmae series have always brought originality and something unique to the table when it comes to creating the game with this unique aspect. You're a young hero and you go on your quests of journeys to explore different types of dungeons and defeating the boss within the dungeons themselves to receive rewards upon defeat. 

## Final Thoughts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally think the game was created very good! I absolutely love the puzzles within the dungeons to add this unique element. If it is just a dungeon, you walk in and go straight to the boss fight, that seems pretty boring. But when they add these puzzle elements and you have to find certain items to move on with the dungeon and unlock more paths, that makes it more exciting! They also add hidden items within certain objects/walls when you use those certain items. I think it is really cool when in order to achieve something, you must have this one item from another dungeon or after you buy it from the item shop in the game. Little things like that, really add this unique aspect to the game to make it more worth playing.
