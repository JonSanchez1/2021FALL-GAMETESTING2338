## Summary

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This game is about you creating your own theme park filled with plenty of rides while also maintaining a good budget. So this game offers two ways to play it, you could either play it as a sandbox mode or as a career. Ideally, if you played RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 & 2, you will have a general idea as to what to expect and how to already play it. For the new players that are playing this game without ever playing the other two, it will be tougher to acknowlege what you're doing and how to play it. Luckily, it has tutorials for the beginners and if you wish to skip them or not play them, that is an option too.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sandbox, you're basically free roaming creating what you desire. You can mess around with a plethora of scenarios here. You're able to build, create almost anything you can think of when it comes to amusement parks. Whether you want to build a water park, Roller coaster park, or even a zoo park, the possibilites are endless! You can also set up different types of scenery, maybe you want something during the day or during the night, or you can even create you're own scenery.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In career mode, you have one objective and it is to make enough funds in a given time frame. The good thing is you mess up or something, you have unlimited tries, you can reset whenever. Here in career mode, you're basically tacking on different scenarios as the difficulty increases each time. So now you have to work with a budget and earn enough funds in a given time frame. You might think it may seem easy but with every new ride or building you build, you're using your funds for that. So you really have to be careful how you spend your money, and if a ride breaks down, that of course cost money to fix it.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This roller coaster game is pretty enjoyable if you like the creative aspect. If you're creative or know how to work with budgets, this game is for you! There is a ton of things that you're able to accomplish. You can full on build a whole amusement park if you wanted to, or maybe you want to experiment with opening your own park some day. This would be a good learning experience if one day you wanted to have that. 

## Final Thoughts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My personal thoughts on this type of game/games is that they are really great to play and have fun with. I've always liked being creative when it comes to creating things or making some sort of scenery so, maybe I just like how creative you can get. I absolutely love how there is endless possibilities on what you are able to make! It can be something small to something enormous For the people that have never played such game, I would recommend them to try this game out. Even if you're not creative, I would say its definitely worth the buy! You don't necessarily have to be creative, just let your imagination run wild!
