## Summary

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brawl Stars is a phenomenal game that is free to play. It's a 3v3 top-down shooting game where players can battle in an engaging fight! The more you play, you'll be unlocking new characters to play as, upgrading your brawlers stats and unlocking new game modes to play in! You can also buy characters and points to upgrade your brawler. They also have the option to buy skins for your characters to wear. Of course, you always have that option to buy gem packs and coin packs as well if  you'd like to buy your way to the top. Recently they added a new feature called the "Brawl Pass". A Brawl Season usually last a little over two months, so you have plenty of time to unlock everything inside of it, if you play daily or every other day. As always you have that option to buy tiers as well, although I wouldn't recommend it as it's not always worth it but it is there for the people to buy.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brawl Stars has some pretty cool game modes to play. You can play Gem Grab, a 3v3 battle where you collect 10 gems as a team until the timer runs down. If you killed during that timer, it will reset each time until a team has 10 gems and is able to successfully hold off until the end of the timer. You can also play Showdown & Duo Showdown, a game where you can choose to go alone or with a partner to fight in an arena to be the last brawler(s) standing! Another would be, Brawl Ball, where you take the ball to the opposite team's goal and score, kind of like soccer. The match officially ends when one team scores 2 goals or at a full time. Throughout the days and weeks, they will also be having special events you can play when they are available. You'll get modes like, Big Game (1v5), Robo Rumble(PvE), Boss Fight (PvE) or Super City Rampage (PvE), among many more!
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So clash royale also consist of arenas. Every time you win, you win a certain amount of trophies that will eventually place you in an arena, the more trophies you have, the higher arena you'll be in. Currently the highest arena there is, is called Legendary Arena. To be in that arena, you'll have to have 5000+ trophies. Don't worry if you lose trophies when you're placed in an arena, you'll be in the arena still unless you drop more than 100 trophies, you will then be demoted to the arena under you. With every arena, you can unlock certain cards pertaining to that arena level. Also when you win, you'll get a chest to be unlocked. Every chest is different and depending on the chest you get, it can take from 3 hours to 24 hours. Lucky for you, you can choose to wait out the time or you can use gems to unlock them. The longer it takes to unlock, the more gems you'll need to unlock it. So be sure to keep on playing until all your chest slots are taken up, you only have 4 chest slots, so it'll be easy for you to fill them!

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now something cool Clash Royale has added, is the tournament events. Inside these tournaments, you'll have a chance to unlock a new card before it gets officially released or get more coins, gems, chests and even magic items. Magic items can be used to upgrade any card even if you dont have the required amount of that card to upgrade. So let's say you have 87/100 until you can upgrade your troop, you can use these magic items in place of the other 13 cards you need to upgrade it. They also have other magic items such as upgrade a card instantly without the use of anything else, or upgrading a card without you needing to spend gold on it. Or you can even get lucky to get a chest key to use it on one of the 4 chest you have among your chest slots. This game has so many cool little things and so much to make the game more fun. Hopefully I'll see you trying out this game sometime soon, give it a try and you wont regret it!
    
## Final Thoughts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, Clash Royale is a really enjoyable game. Every battle you fight is real-time action so you're not just fighting against an AI. You're fighting against a real player trying to achieve the same win you want. I love what this game brings, they're always adding new cards, new troops, spells, all kinds of cards. In between those fights, you can emote against your oponents to taunt them. You can also battle with your friends or against them to practice any new decks you might have created. There is endless posibilites on how you can create your own battle deck and move up arenas. The higher arena you're in, the better players you'll be up against so be prepared to outsmart them!
