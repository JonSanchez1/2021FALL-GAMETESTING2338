## Summary

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brawl Stars is a phenomenal game that is free to play. It's a 3v3 top-down shooting game where players can battle in an engaging fight! The more you play, you'll be unlocking new characters to play as, upgrading your brawlers stats and unlocking new game modes to play in! You can also buy characters and points to upgrade your brawler. They also have the option to buy skins for your characters to wear. Of course, you always have that option to buy gem packs and coin packs as well if  you'd like to buy your way to the top. Recently they added a new feature called the "Brawl Pass". A Brawl Season usually last a little over two months, so you have plenty of time to unlock everything inside of it, if you play daily or every other day. As always you have that option to buy tiers as well, although I wouldn't recommend it as it's not always worth it but it is there for the people to buy.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brawl Stars has some pretty cool game modes to play. You can play Gem Grab, a 3v3 battle where you collect 10 gems as a team until the timer runs down. If you killed during that timer, it will reset each time until a team has 10 gems and is able to successfully hold off until the end of the timer. You can also play Showdown & Duo Showdown, a game where you can choose to go alone or with a partner to fight in an arena to be the last brawler(s) standing! Another would be, Brawl Ball, where you take the ball to the opposite team's goal and score, kind of like soccer. The match officially ends when one team scores 2 goals or at a full time. Throughout the days and weeks, they will also be having special events you can play when they are available. You'll get modes like, Big Game (1v5), Robo Rumble(PvE), Boss Fight (PvE) or Super City Rampage (PvE), among many more!
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are also able to get the brawl pass. Inside the brawl pass, you can earn skins, characters, pins (emotes), coins, gems, points to upgrade your characters and boxes that contains pretty much anything. You have Brawl Boxes, Big Box and Mega Box that consist of any random thing reward that helps you. Mega Boxes contain the most, so you'll get the most rewards out of it. Something that is a nice feature they added is, even once you completed the brawl pass, you're still able to get Big Boxes for every 500 tokens earned. Tokens are used for advancing in the brawl pass through each tier or when brawl pass id completed, it would be Big Boxes. You will also get power points to be able to upgrade your brawlers as long as you have enough coins that is. 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the nicer features has to be the trophy road. You first start off at 0 trophies and you work your way up as you play. You unlock brawlers, game modes, quests, Boxes, coins and gems. The max trophies one can get currently is 50,000 trophies. After you hit a certain numbers of trophies above 15,000 its all Big Boxes and Mega Boxes you can open up as rewards. I think what's cool about it is, it's a total combined trophies throughout all your brawlers' individual trophies. Meaning you can play as one brawler then you can play as another brawler and you'll still be able to climb the trophy ladder combined. The trophy road is approximately 4 weeks, and after those 4 weeks, your brawler with over 500 trophies will lose a certain number of trophies as the league resets. However, these trophies are converted into star points that can be spent on items from the Star Shop!
    
## Final Thoughts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My personal thoughts on this game, is it may seem slow at the beginning because you don't have many brawlers and such but the more you play, the more addicting it becomes. You start unlocking more game modes, brawlers and points to upgrade your brawlers. You're also given the opportunity to complete quests when one unlocks them. The enjoyment of playing online with others as a team or going up against them to prove who is the better brawler is really well done! This game brings in a ton of different brawlers you can choose from and each brawler has different abilities to use up against your opponents. At the end of the day, it's not what brawler you use, it's on how you use that brawler against others online. You never know what you're up against until you notice how one plays. The best part of it all, is you can even play with your friends!
