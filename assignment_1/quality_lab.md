I chose Valorant, I like how new the game feels and is. You can either play casually or if you're in the mood to play more competitive, you can play ranked and test your skills more against other good players. Comparing this game against others like cs:go or fortnite, it's not as skill based where you need alot of skill to play the other games similiar to this genre. I like how easy it is to learn this game and play. I personally love playing casually.

We all chose different types of games because one person likes a certain type of game and another person likes another type of game. One of my team members had said he likes story mode games because he isn't a hufe fan of online games because they require skill now a days. Another team member had chosen chosen a similiar type of what I had said but just different format, like we both liked multiplayer games but he liked more competitive type of games. He likes more of the skill based games.
