I chose Valorant, I like how new the game feels and is. You can either play casually or if you're in the mood to play more competitive, you can play ranked and test your skills more against other good players. Comparing this game against others like cs:go or fortnite, it's not as skill based where you need alot of skill to play the other games similiar to this genre. I like how easy it is to learn this game and play.
